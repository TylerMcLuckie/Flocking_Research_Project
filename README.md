## Flocking and Predator Techniques in Video Games

"... and the thousands of fishes moved as a huge beast, piercing the water. They appeared united, inexorably bound to a common fate. How comes this unity?"
 --Anonymous, 17th century (from Shaw)
 
In my independent research, I have explored various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and concepts. I will specifically be writing about what I have learned about flocking and predators in video games. As I have a mix of learning styles, I have applied what I have learned by building a test scene in unity to gain a practical understanding and retain what I have been researching. I will be discussing these concepts further in detail. Firstly, I would like to discuss a brief introduction to AI in video games
